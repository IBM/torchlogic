This repository contains open-source code
for the paper
[Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13912).

Currently,
we release the `tf.keras.Model` for NAM which can be simply plugged into any neural network training procedure. We also provide helpers for
building a computation graph using NAM for classification/regression problems with `tf.compat.v1`.
The `nam_train.py` file provides the example of a training script on a single
dataset split.

Use `./run.sh` test script to ensure that the setup is correct.

## Multi-task NAMs
The code for multi task NAMs can be found at [https://github.com/lemeln/nam](https://github.com/lemeln/nam).

## Dependencies

The code was tested under Ubuntu 16 and uses these packages:

- tensorflow>=1.15
- numpy>=1.15.2
- sklearn>=0.23
- pandas>=0.24
- absl-py

## Datasets

The datasets used in the paper (except MIMIC-II) can be found in the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/nam_datasets/data"> public GCP bucket</a> `gs://nam_datasets/data`, which can be downloaded using [gsutil][gsutil]. To install gsutil, follow the instructions [here][gsutil_install]. The preprocessed version of MIMIC-II dataset, used in the NAM paper, can be
shared only if you provide us with the signed data use agreement to the MIMIC-III Clinical
Database on the <a href="https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/#physionet-credentialing">PhysioNet website</a>.
