# Getting Started

#### Install the latest version of torchlogic

The `torchlogic` package can be installed by cloning the repo, using poetry and pip.  
Installing via pip will enable you to
use the R-NRN to solve classification and regression problems, or
to develop new Neural Reasoning Network based models using the `torchlogic`
framework.

```commandline
poetry install
poetry build
pip install <path/to/wheel>
```
